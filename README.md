## Workouts
This project is focused on good object-oriented programming, adjusted to the way I write down my own workouts.
If you find anything which is "badly written" or shows signs of a bad structure, let me know. I'm always learning!

### How can I make use of it?
There is no main function or anything similar included, so if you want to make use of the classes, create your own one.
To create a Workout object, you can either create every object by yourself, or just pass a valid string.
Feel free to implement it in your own project the way you like, but I would appreciate you mentioning me somewhere if you do so.

### Language
- String input and outputs of toString() methods are in German, but nearly everything just numbers.
- Machine names are primarily in English, but some names are still in German.
- The code and comments are completely in English.

### Tests
- The tests ensure a high coverage.
- Some inputs of test methods may be slightly arbitrary.
